# On Being Together

<p>When working together or if things go wrong,<br/>
we acknowledge and work through differences.<br/>
In so doing, we transform and enlarge each other.</p>

<p>To nurture our mutual growth,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is a place of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learning, understanding, and sharing;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is a place to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affirm tolerance and compassion;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is a place for<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collaborative creativity.</p>

<p>All the aspects of yourself you choose to bring to this place<br/>
are welcome here.</p>

<p>Reciprocate! Welcome, embrace and learn from others<br/>
(even in the face of apparent hostility or misunderstanding).</p>

<p>To act against this spirit invites ostracism,<br/>
a loss that diminishes us all.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
