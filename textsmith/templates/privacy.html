may not be able to contact you or deliver TextSmith.</p>

<h2>Change of purpose</h2>
<p>We will only use your personal information for the purposes

need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible
with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal
information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we
will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
<p>Please note that we may process your personal information
without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above
rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>

<h2>Do we need your consent?</h2>
<p>We may approach you for your written consent to allow us to
process certain particularly sensitive personal data. If we do
so, we will provide you with full details of the information that
we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can
carefully consider whether you wish to consent. You should be
aware that, in accordance with our written policy document, there
are circumstances permitted by law where we may use particularly
sensitive personal data without you consent.</p>

  days to request a reconsideration.</li>

  consent and where appropriate measures are in place to
  safeguard your rights.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we make an automated decision on the basis of any
particularly sensitive personal information, we must have either
your explicit written consent or it must be justified in the
public interest, and we must also put in place appropriate
measures to safeguard your rights.</p>
<p>You will not be subject to decisions that will have a
significant impact on you based solely on automated
decision-making, unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and
we have notified you.</p>

and to treat it in accordance with the law.</p>

respect of your personal information.</p>

<h3>Why might you share my personal information with third

confidentiality. Details of these measures may be obtained from

<h2>Data retention</h2>

for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or
reporting requirements. Details of retention periods for
different aspects of your personal information are available in
our retention policy which is available from our Data Protection
Officer. To determine the appropriate retention period for
personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of
the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised
use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which
we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
purposes through other means, and the applicable legal
requirements.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal
information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in
which case we may use such information without further notice to
you. We will retain and securely destroy your personal
information in accordance with our data retention policy and/or
applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<h2>Rights of access, correction, erasure, and restriction</h2>
<h3>Your duty to inform us of changes</h3>
<p>It is important that the personal information we hold about
you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your
personal information changes during your working relationship
with us.</p>

<h3>Your rights in connection with personal information</h3>
<p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Request access to your personal information (commonly known
  as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to
  receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you
  and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
  <li>Request correction of the personal information that we hold
  about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or
  inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</li>
  <li>Request erasure of your personal information. This enables
  you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where
  there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You
  also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal
  information where you have exercised your right to object to
  processing (see below).</li>
  <li>Object to processing of your personal information where we
  are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third
  party) and there is something about your particular situation
  which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
  You also have the right to object where we are processing your
  personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
  <li>Request the restriction of processing of your personal
  information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
  processing of personal information about you, for example if
  you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for
  processing it.</li>
  <li>Request the transfer of your personal information to
  another party.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of
your personal information, object to the processing of your
personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your
personal information to another party, please contact <a href="mailto:hello@camerata.io">hello@camerata.io</a> in writing.</p>

<h3>No fee usually required</h3>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal
information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However,
we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is
clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to
comply with the request in such circumstances.</p>

<h3>What we may need from you</h3>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help
us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the
information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is
another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal
information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to
receive it.</p>

<h3>Right to withdraw consent</h3>
<p>In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your
consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your
personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right
to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any
time. To withdraw your consent, please contact
<a href="mailto:hello@camerata.io">hello@camerata.io</a>.
Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your
consent, we will no longer process your information for the
purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have
another legitimate basis for doing so in law.</p>

<h3>Data protection officer</h3>
<p>We have appointed a data protection officer (DPO) to oversee
compliance with this privacy notice. If you have any questions
about this privacy notice or how we handle your personal
information, please contact the DPO. You have the right to make a
complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office
(ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection
issues.</p>

<h3>Changes to this privacy notice</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to update this privacy notice at any
time, and we will provide you with a new privacy notice when we
make any substantial updates. We may also notify you in other
ways from time to time about the processing of your personal
information.</p>
